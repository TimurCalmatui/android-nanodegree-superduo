# Super Duo!
This is Android Developer Nanodegree Project 3. It contains two apps: Alexandria and Football Scores.

__NOTE__: In Football Scores it's recommended to provide your own API key for 
[api.football-data.org](http://api.football-data.org/alpha/fixtures). 
You can set one as `api_key` in `strings.xml`.

## Note on added dependencies
Barcode scanning feature for Alexandria app is implemented using 
[ZXing Android Embedded](https://github.com/journeyapps/zxing-android-embedded) 
library which is based on powerful [ZXing library](https://github.com/zxing/zxing).
